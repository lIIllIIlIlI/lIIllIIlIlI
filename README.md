ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lIIllIIlIlI and working in the embedded industry. In my free time, i like to play around with any kind of languages
and projects, mainly to build small daily helpers. I'm interested in basically everything IT that doesnt involve frontend/gui.
Currently, im learning Rust and tinker around with deep learning. 
Always try to improve code quality, simply because i love to look at clean code.
